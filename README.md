# Pi-Hole-Blocklists-December-2025
This repository contains the blocklist sources used by my Pi-hole instance. A collection of Pi-hole adlist URLs used for network-wide DNS-level ad, tracker, and malware blocking. These blocklists are extracted directly from a Pi-hole v6 gravity database and are intended for easy import, backup, or sharing between Pi-hole instances.
